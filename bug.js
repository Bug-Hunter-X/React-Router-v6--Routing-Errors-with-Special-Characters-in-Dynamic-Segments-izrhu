In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that contains special characters (like +, *, etc.) can lead to unexpected behavior or routing errors.  The problem arises when these characters aren't properly escaped in the URL or when the route definition doesn't handle them correctly.  For example, a route like `/products/+symbol` might not match if the + character isn't properly URL encoded.

```javascript
// Incorrect route definition that doesn't handle special characters properly
<Route path='/products/:symbol' element={<ProductDetails />} />

// URL with special characters
window.location.href = '/products/+symbol';
```
